# ELASTIC Implementation Log

## Project Overview
ELASTIC (Enclave Layer for Secure Time, Information, and Cryptography) is a Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) for AMD SEV-SNP VMs.

## Implementation Progress

### Clock Interface
- ✅ Implemented secure time measurements
- ✅ Added monotonic clock support
- ✅ Implemented timezone handling
- ✅ Added WIT bindings
- ✅ Created comprehensive tests

### File Interface
- ✅ Implemented secure file operations
- ✅ Added encryption support (AES-GCM)
- ✅ Implemented file metadata handling
- ✅ Added WIT bindings
- ✅ Created comprehensive tests

### Crypto Interface
- ✅ Defined WIT interface
- ✅ Started implementation
- ⚠️ In Progress: Fixing compilation issues
  - Need to fix RSA signing implementation
  - Need to resolve HMAC initialization
  - Need to update dependencies

## Current Status
- Clock Interface: Complete and tested
- File Interface: Complete and tested
- Crypto Interface: In progress, needs fixes

## Next Steps
1. Fix Crypto Interface compilation issues:
   - Update RSA signing implementation
   - Fix HMAC initialization
   - Resolve dependency conflicts
2. Complete Crypto Interface tests
3. Consider implementing standard (non-SEV) versions of interfaces

## Notes
- All interfaces follow WIT specification
- Tests are comprehensive and passing for completed interfaces
- Documentation is maintained in README.md
- WIT interfaces are stored in tests/wit/

## Questions & Decisions
1. Q: Should we implement standard (non-SEV) versions of these interfaces?
   A: Yes, would need new implementations for:
   - Clock: Standard system time functions
   - File: Regular file system operations
   - Crypto: Standard cryptographic libraries
   
   Suggested structure:
   ```
   src/
   ├── sev/           # SEV-SNP specific implementations
   │   ├── clock.rs
   │   ├── file.rs
   │   └── crypto.rs
   ├── standard/      # Regular environment implementations
   │   ├── clock.rs
   │   ├── file.rs
   │   └── crypto.rs
   └── lib.rs         # Exports appropriate implementations
   ```
