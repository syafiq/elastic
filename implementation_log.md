# Implementation Log

## 2024-03-21: WASM Implementation and SEV-SNP Support

### Changes Made
- Implemented WASM file operations with proper error handling
- Added SEV-SNP detection and secure file operations
- Created WASM example demonstrating file operations
- Fixed file handle management and mutability issues
- Improved error messages and type safety

### Files Modified
- `crates/elastic-file/src/wasm.rs`: Added WASM implementation
- `crates/elastic-file/src/sev/mod.rs`: Enhanced SEV-SNP support
- `crates/elastic-file/src/linux/file.rs`: Improved error handling
- `crates/elastic-file/src/common/mod.rs`: Updated common interfaces
- Added `crates/wasm-file-example/`: New WASM example

### Technical Details
- Implemented WASI file operations for WASM environment
- Added AES-GCM encryption for SEV-SNP mode
- Improved error handling with `FileError` enum
- Enhanced file handle management with proper mutability
- Added comprehensive test coverage

### Testing
- Verified WASM implementation in standard Linux environment
- Tested SEV-SNP mode with encryption
- Validated file operations (open, read, write, seek, flush, close)
- Confirmed proper error handling and type safety

### Next Steps
- Add more test cases for edge conditions
- Implement additional security features
- Enhance documentation
- Consider performance optimizations
